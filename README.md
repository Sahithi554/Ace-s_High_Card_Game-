# Ace-s_High_Card_Game-
 Tableau columns are numbered 1,2,3,4.  Only the card at the bottom of a Tableau column can be moved. A card can be moved to the Foundation only if a higher ranked card of the same suit is at the bottom of another Tableau column. To win, all cards except aces must be in the Foundation.
